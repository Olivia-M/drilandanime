### A Detailed List of Recommendations for E-cigarettes 


Those who smoke cigarettes know that it is difficult to give up smoking. It is always futile to try patches or pills. But for millions of ex-smokers, what could be more effective than switching to e-cigarettes? However, there are so many e-cigarettes available on the market. How can we separate the best from the rest among hundreds of e-cigs manufacturers? Here’s a breakdown of the best e-cigarettes on the market. Each e-cigarette has their own advantages.

#### 1. JUUL——Best Flavors

JUUL, as a famous closed pod system, is easy to use. But what’s impressive is the flavors it provides. The JUUL Starter Kit comes with four flavors: Mango Nectar, Royal Creme, Golden Tobacco and Glacier Mint. Out of these 4, Golden Tobacco and Glacier Mint held the consensus for the best tasting option, especially for those who miss the old-school flavor of tobacco cigarettes, but Mango Nectar and Royal Creme didn't fall far behind in terms of preference and vapers with a sweet tooth are likely to gravitate towards those flavors more, particularly young people. The battery life is about eight hours and it will take about an hour to reach a full recharge. This is maybe a drawback for some vapers looking for long-lasting vaping.

#### 3. V2 Cigs——Best Cig-a-like

For those who are new to e-cigarettes or want to quit traditional cigarettes, then cig-a-like can be a good choice. Cig-a-like has the familiar look and feel of traditional cigarettes which makes it easier for smokers to switch to electronic cigarettes. Here are two rather popular cig-a-likes, V2 Cigs and Halo G6.  
Founded in 2009 in Florida, V2 Cigs was one of the original companies to develop e-cigarettes before the trend really took off. V2 Cigs disposables have been around for years with its two flavors – tobacco and menthol. The nicotine content of this electronic cigarette is 18mg, not very high but it still tastes like traditional cigarettes. It's a good choice for people who want to quit smoking. Vapor production and flavor are some of the best and they activate automatically each time when you take a puff. V2 Cigs give users a good throat hit as well as great vapor. Above all, V2 Cigs can be the best choice in cig-a-likes.

#### 4. Halo G6——Best E-juice

Unlike the V2 Cigs, Halo has a reputation for making some of the best e-juice in cig-a-likes.

Its cartomizers are easy to swap and come in both pre-filled and blank options. The kit comes with one USB charger, a wall charger, two 78mm automatic batteries, and five cartomizers.

#### 5.Apollo Starter Kit——Best Real Tobacco Flavor

After trying the cig-a-likes and closed pod systems, vape pens are a worthwhile option as well. Apollo Starter kit is one of those and it has some differences from other e-cig brands. While focusing on battery life and easy-to-use design, the unique feature of this e-cigarette is that it pays more attention to the tobacco-flavored juice. They currently only offer two flavors, tobacco and menthol, but the taste is spot-on. Their tobacco flavors come in five different strengths, ranging from 0mg to 24mg. Its long-lasting batteries enable even heavy vapers last all day. It is an excellent choice for people looking for the most real tobacco flavor and those who intend to replace traditional cigarettes with electronic cigarettes for a long time.
