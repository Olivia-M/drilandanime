### And this "Truth" Campaign "Fact" Isn't Possibly True

![](/images/1.jpg)

Among the oft-repeated "facts" getting disseminated by the "fact" campaign is that a single Juul pod is add up to 20 cigarettes value of nicotine.

More specifically, the "truth" campaign claims, due to its #1 most significant fact about Juul that: "The volume of nicotine in a single JUUL cartridge is roughly add up to the volume of nicotine in a good pack of cigarettes."

Joining the "truth" plan in spreading this kind of factual information is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose website currently states that: "an individual JUUL pod consists of as much smoking as a pack of 20 regular cigarettes." 

This "fact" has spread like wildfire. Being an example, a parenting content in a media magazine writes: "Each JUUL pod provides the approximate equal to 1 pack of smoking cigarettes, or 200 puffs. Therefore, if a user undergoes one JUUL pod a day, this is the nicotine equivalent of cigarette smoking a pack of smokes a day."

Similarly, the appropriately named "Scary Mommy" internet site warns that: "one Juul “pod” contains 20 cigarettes worth of nicotine (that’s a pack of regular cigarettes)."

It's not simply scary mommy blogs that happen to be disseminating this "critical fact" about Juul. The huge tech-internet site "Inc." possesses this to state about Juul: "The secret is its uniquely powerful formula--a solo pod contains roughly as many nicotine as a good pack of smokes."

I could continue and on with illustrations. The Chicago Daily Herald reviews that: "The majority of Juul's solo pods contain the same volume of nicotine as a pack of cigarettes." Collegiate Times tells viewers that "Constructed to be more convenient when compared to a cigarette, JUULs happen to be arguably more addictive as one pod is the exact carbon copy of 20 smoking cigarettes (or a typical pack of smokes)...". Vogue magazine reported that even "Dan from Poison Control" apparently informed one worried caller that the quantity of nicotine in a Juul  pod is accurately the same as the quantity of nicotine in an complete pack of smoking cigarettes: "Dan from Poison Control called me back again to say that a refreshing Juul pod gets the same amount of nicotine as 20 cigarettes."

One respiratory therapist warned that because a solo Juul pod contains as much nicotine as a good pack of cigarettes, a good youth who vapes is in danger of dying from nicotine poisoning: "Juul, which is just about the most popular makes out there, contains the exact carbon copy of 20 cigarettes. Many times, a bottle of e-liquid can support the same sum of nicotine as a pack of smokes. That means kids, who might like the taste and puff, puff, puff and proceed through the complete container, are taking in 20 cigarettes worth of nicotine. This abrupt increase in nicotine can cause nicotine poisoning, a probably fatal condition."

#### All of those other Story

There are two extreme problems with this claim by the "truth" campaign.

First, the concept that it is sending to children is that you will be better off smoking 19 cigarettes than vaping 1 Juul pod. This evaluation certainly helps it be sound like Juuling will be a lot worse than smoking. And if that's so, then the clear concept is that you will be better off smoking than Juuling.

That's clearly the message that the "truth" plan and other anti-tobacco companies and health companies are sending to open public health practitioners. For example, the National Centre for Health Exploration informed its viewers that vaping is definitely no safer than smoking. A magazine devoted to asthma and allergy symptoms told its viewers that e-smoking cigarettes will be no safer than cigarettes for youngsters with asthma.

This message is a potentially damaging one from a public health perspective. It undermines the public's appreciation of the extreme hazards of smoking and obviously, if any kids finish up smoking rather than Juuling because of these details, it might have disastrous consequences.

Apparently, I'm not the only person who sees the situation with this message. Numerous young people required to Twitter with the same communication:

"This JUUL point is so Dumb I wanna smoke cigarettes 19 Cigarettes."

"Hey guys.. period to smoke 19 smokes instead of a juul pod cause it’s better for you!!!!" 

"Okay I’ll just smoke cigarettes 19 cigarettes rather than my Juul now, thank you for the advice!" 

 "yeah f__k the juul choose smoke 19 cigarettes instead."

But there's a second, possibly more subtle difficulty with the claim:

It's not true.

It doesn't take a sophisticated math level to fact-check this promise. We just want two bits of information:

1. The most highly concentrated Juul pod (there are two concentrations) has 40 mg of nicotine.

2. An average cigarette contains about 12 mg of nicotine.

Therefore, a Juul pod provides the quantity of nicotine equivalent to that in about 3 cigarettes (not 20 cigarettes).

Moreover, there is little or nothing terribly unique about the Juul regarding nicotine content. There are a huge selection of kinds of e-liquids available to buy that contain 24 mg of nicotine per cartridge, with a cartridge providing about 200 puffs, similar to a Juul pod. So the truth is, the Juul contains significantly less than twice the quantity of nicotine present in a great many other electronic cigarettes.

Concentrating on the nicotine articles obscures a more essential aspect, one which does basically separate out Juul by most other vaping goods. That factor may be the amount of absorption of nicotine in to the bloodstream. Due to nicotine formulation used in Juul (i.e., a nicotine salt), it is absorbed rapidly in to the bloodstream and the design of nicotine amounts in the blood as time passes mimics that of cigarette smoking. That is unlike the design for almost every other kind of electronic cigarette available to buy, which uniformly deliver nicotine quite ineffectively and for that reason have a low dependency potential. By concentrating on the nicotine content material, instead of the formulation, the "real truth" advertising campaign and CDC happen to be obscuring the most important information that people need to understand.

This commentary isn't to reduce the addictive potential of Juul, the actual fact that there is a higher level of nicotine absorption from Juul (higher than from virtually all other e-cigarettes), or that the pattern of nicotine in the bloodstream as time passes made by the Juul does mimic that of using tobacco. It is just to highlight there are a whole lot of exaggerated promises out there and in addition to simply being incorrect, some of these promises could actually do public health harm.
