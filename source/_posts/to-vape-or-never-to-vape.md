A couple of years ago, the administration at Texas Talk about University, where We teach, passed a regulation that abolished smoking everywhere on campus, inside and away.  I've mixed feelings relating to this.  Personally, I have hardly ever smoked.  Both my father and mother were moderate to hefty smokers, and my dad died of lung cancers at age 57.  THEREFORE I am acquainted with the harm cigarette smoking can do.  Alternatively,  some find widespread bans on personal patterns that have at least some redeeming features as misuse of governmental authority.  General, I was mildly delighted by the ban, therefore when I walked by students lounge area in our building last week and found what I assumed was a puff of cigarette smoke, I was surprised.

But on better inspection, the student ended up being "vaping":  cigarette smoking (or whatever the correct verb is here now) an electronic cigarette.  Was that violating the cigarette smoking ban or not?  So far, the university hasn't ruled on whether vaping counts as cigarette smoking.  Since electronic smoking cigarettes are unquestionably an constructed product, their production, sales, and make use of fall within the purview of engineering ethics. 

A go to to the website HowStuffWorks.com informed me personally a Chinese pharmacist invented e-cigarettes ten years ago.  They depend on small lithium batteries because of their power source, and rechargeable lithium batteries themselves haven't been with us for a lot longer than that.  The energy undergoes a voltage regulator to a little heating element, in which a answer of nicotine in propylene glycol can be vaporized and inhaled by an individual.  The stuff becomes a finely dispersed mist after exhaling and looks unique of true tobacco smoke, probably for the reason that particles are greater and evaporate instead of dispersing.  The current form of the device was originally marketed as an aid to help people quit smoking, but as with many such helps for addiction, the treatment may not be very much of a noticable difference over the disease.

Who is damaged by vaping?  Very well, there are the manufacturers of the merchandise and its auxiliary apparatus and items:  chargers, the nicotine solution, the e-smoking cigarettes themselves.  There are users, many however, not most of whom are former smokers of real smoking cigarettes.  There will be the makers of standard tobacco products, who may either look and feel threatened by the new development or may co-opt it once the market gets large enough, and begin selling similar products themselves.  There are several organizational entities which range from private companies up to things like europe, which are actually tasked with deciding imagine if anything to do about vaping.  And last, but hopefully not really least, there may be the general non-smoking open public for whom second-hand-smoke cigarettes bans had been enacted.  But partly because e-cigarettes are so new, nobody has a large amount of solid data on the side effects and whether second-side nicotine-tinged propylene glycol is certainly something to worry about. 

Hong Kong and Singapore, among additional countries, have imposed flat-out bans on e-cigarettes, but most nations either haven't any laws about them or impose sole mild regulation.  Their status in the U. S. has been the subject of numerous court conditions, and attempts to get them classified as medicine delivery devices have already been unsuccessful.  The latest court ruling, which is more definite than logical, says they might be regulated simply as tobacco products, which is a little like classifying tires as agricultural goods because rubber originates from trees.  But the impact can be that governments can't do anything to e-cigarettes that they can not do to regular smokes.  Consequently, some state governments have banned product sales to minors, but that's about the level of U. S. regulation so far.

It seems if you ask me that e-cigarettes are about the nicotine, which has been proved time and again to be addictive.  But consequently has alcohol, and most of us really know what a flop Prohibition was.  I confess that I don't relish the thought of attending a celebration at which I discover many of my good friends or learners sucking on phony smoking cigarettes, but again, I don't go to a lot of parties anyway.  Within the last couple of years, the latent puritanical streak in American way of life has fastened onto cigarettes, with the effect that many people who smoke, together with most non-smokers, respect the cigarette behavior as a disreputable vice.  Which attitude itself will probably keep e-smoking cigarettes from becoming as prevalent as cellphones, for instance.

The medical and health evidence on vaping is still largely lacking, so the precautionary principle says to keep it alone until it has been tested to be safe, whatever "safe" means in this context.  The primary materials of the vapor-nicotine and propylene glycol-are well-understood substances.  Nicotine use in virtually any kind is psychologically addictive, but doesn't itself cause malignancy.  Propylene glycol, if pure, is approved for use in foods.  So it is unlikely that their combination in e-smoking cigarettes poses a sinister unidentified risk, although one can't make certain without the correct long-term studies.

The thing I dislike the most about e-smoking cigarettes is normally that they present yet another chance for people, especially young people, to become reliant on an expensive habit that normally doesn't make the environment a much better place.  I say that in full knowledge that a number of the historical numbers I most admire, incorporating G. K. Chesterton and C. S. Lewis, had been smokers, certainly not of e-cigarettes but of the initial old smelly tobacco items themselves.  E-smoking cigarettes happen to be an addition to a spectrum of products that are probably habit-forming, goods that lie on a spectrum whose mildest end includes espresso and tea, and whose contrary malignant end winds up with heroin and crystal meth.  Some persons can select to stay in one put on the harmless end of that spectrum, while others find they are drawn through the milder goods to take hazardous and unlawful risks at the other end.  This is simply not to state that everyone who attempts e-cigarettes will end up addicted to them, or begins smoking real ones.  But some will.  And may be the satisfaction, or whatever fulfillment that people get from their website, worth the chance to those who may find they are being handled by their habit, instead of the other way around?  We don't know, but it can be a risk both governments and people should consider seriously.
