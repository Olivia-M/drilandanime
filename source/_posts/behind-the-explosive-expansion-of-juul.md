The survey results donate to a growing collection of evidence that JUUL’s popularity with young people is driving its unprecedented growth. For example, a recently available Truth Initiative analysis published in Tobacco Control discovered that teens between 15 and 17 years old have 16 times higher probability of using JUUL than 25- to 34-year-olds, with almost 10 percent of these having attempted JUUL and a lot more than 6 percent reporting current employ. Info from the National Youth Tobacco Survey show current e-cigarette employ among huge schoolers reached more than 20 percent in 2018 - which represents a 78 percent upsurge in one year.

### Rapid Increase In Teenagers Trying JUUL

Truth Initiative experts collected data about JUUL use beginning in July 2017 from a weekly study conducted among 140 to 240 youth and adults ages 15 to 24.

Over the 15 a few months of the survey period from July 2017 to October 2018, which included a total of 14,479 15- to 24-year-olds sampled, there is a far more than fivefold upsurge in youth and adults reporting that they tried JUUL. Another survey conducted in past due July and early on September 2018 determined not just that many young persons have used the merchandise, but that they started young. The majority of those who ever utilized a JUUL or e-cigarette - 56 percent - had been younger than 18 if they first tried it.

Over roughly twelve months, the number of adults between 18 and 21 years old who tried JUUL increased a lot more than 400 percent from July 2017 to October 2018. Among younger users aged 15 to 17 years good old, the numbers were a lot more stark: a lot more than eight circumstances as many 15- to 17-year-olds had attempted JUUL in October 2018 than in August 2017.

The quantity of teens between 15 and 17 years old who tried JUUL also rose substantially in September, which may be associated with teens’ go back to school.

### Why Young People Are Using JUUL

Reasons young persons use JUUL or perhaps e-cigarettesThe surveys also revealed causes that young persons use JUUL. The most notable reasons for using JUUL or e-cigarettes relate with its popularity with other teenagers, the variety of flavors, its perception as not as much harmful than other items and its capability to deliver a “buzz,” according to the more than 600 youth and young adults surveyed during summer 2018 who reported ever before employing JUUL or e-cigarettes.

Nearly half - 47 percent - reported using JUUL or e-cigarettes because friends make make use of it and 29 percent attributed use to all of the flavors, including mango, fruit medley and mint. This selecting is constant with past analysis on flavored e-cigarettes and their charm to youth. A study that included middle and high school students discovered that 43 percent of youth who ever before used e-cigarettes attempted them as a result of appealing flavors.

25 % of young persons surveyed who ever used JUUL or e-cigarettes cited the perception that it's less harmful than other forms of tobacco, and slightly a lesser amount of - 21 percent - said they use JUUL since it offers them a “buzz.” Despite various using JUUL to feel the effects of nicotine, it is uncertain whether little people know about the nicotine content of the product. IN REALITY Initiative research published in Tobacco Control in planting season 2017, 63 percent of 15- to 24-year-olds surveyed were unaware that JUUL goods always contain nicotine.

### Why JUUL Matters

JUUL’s compact style that resembles a USB flash drive and availability in lovely, fruity flavors contribute to its popularity among teens. These devices has become hence common among youth and adults that they have termed the practice of using it as “JUULing.” Regardless of the company’s claim that it only markets its goods to adult smokers, there are numerous examples of company-sponsored and organic social media promotion of the merchandise - calling into query JUUL’s statements that the product’s youth user basic is purely accidental.

JUUL also has among the highest degrees of nicotine among e-cigarettes available to buy. Before the intro of JUUL, the most used e-cigarette products contained nicotine strengths of between approximately 1 percent and 2.4 percent. When JUUL debuted, its pods contained 5 percent nicotine power. Furthermore, the manufacturers of JUUL claim that their nicotine salt formulation escalates the rate and volume of nicotine delivered into the blood, compared with other formulations.

Nicotine is harmful to developing brains: more youthful users will become addicted, have more difficulty quitting and could be in higher risk for habit to other substances later on. Young adults who use e-cigarettes and who weren't prior smokers and had been at low risk to become future smokers have already been found to become more than four times more likely to begin smoking cigarettes tobacco cigarettes within 18 months weighed against their peers who do not use e-cigarettes.

It is truly concerning, then, not only how many young persons have tried JUUL, but also how frequent regular users grab the product. According to the recent Truth Initiative analysis released in Tobacco Control, more than half of 15- to 17-year-outdated current JUUL users reported employing it on three or more days during the past month and over one-quarter reported employing it on 10 or more times. The National Youth Tobacco Study found that the amount of high school students using e-smokes at least 20 of the last thirty days rose from 20 percent to 27.7 percent from 2017 to 2018.

### Action Needed

The predominance of JUUL available on the market, coupled with survey info from youth and adults, reveal a troubling truth: the JUUL phenomenon is a large and growing trend among teenagers. Products like JUUL happen to be addicting a new generation of young people and adding them at risk for a lot more dangerous combustible tobacco work with, which risks reversing decades of improvement in tobacco control.

Truth Initiative has prolonged supported measures that could make tobacco items, including e-cigarettes, less attractive to youth, and make sure that youth don't have easy access to the merchandise. While we are motivated by recent enforcement activities from the meals and Drug Administration about the advertising of e-smoking cigarettes to youth, we wish that the FDA will need swift regulatory actions to safeguard youth from these products. Those measures include:

- Fully reviewing e-cigarette products to make certain that they benefit public health just before allowing them that you can buy
- Removing flavors by e-cigarettes, unless a supplier can show a flavor plays a part in completely switching from combustible goods to e-smoking cigarettes and that it does not appeal to youth
- Prohibiting internet and non-face-to-face sales of e-cigarettes

These data also underscore the necessity for even more FDA regulatory action to restrict the advertising and promotional attempts of e-cigarettes to more youthful audiences and establish mechanisms to reduce the sale of JUUL to minors. While we've been encouraged by recent FDA pronouncements recognizing this imperative, we also motivate quick action. The FDA has a large amount of catching up to accomplish, and, as the JUUL encounter has starkly demonstrated, the best time to do something is before something becomes widely used in middle and high schools in the united states - not after.
